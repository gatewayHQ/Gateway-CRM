# Database Migrations

This folder holds **apply-once, ordered** SQL changes for the Gateway CRM
Supabase database. `src/lib/schema.sql` is the full, re-runnable description of
the *current* schema (safe to run top-to-bottom on a brand-new database). These
migration files are the deltas that bring an **existing** database up to match
it.

Run each file in the **Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor**. Apply them in number
order. Every file is idempotent (`if exists` / `if not exists`), so re-running a
file is safe.

> The application code does not run these automatically and has no access to do
> so — a human applies them through the SQL Editor.

## Apply order

| # | File | What it does | Changes behavior? | When to run |
|---|------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 0001 | `0001_drop_mailing_v1.sql` | Drops the dead legacy mailing tables (`mail_campaigns`, `mail_sends`, `mail_suppressions`) | No — they have zero code references | Anytime |
| 0003 | `0003_consolidate_ghost_tables.sql` | Creates the tables that were previously defined ad-hoc in component "run this SQL" panels; drops the orphan `envelopes`; adds `created_at` to `docusign_envelopes` | No — uses `if not exists`, touches no data | Anytime |
| 0002 | `0002_rls_agent_scoping.sql` | Real RLS: enforces the existing agent/team scoping in the database (two phases — see below) | **Phase A: no. Phase B: yes (activates enforcement)** | After 0003, with testing |

> Note the numeric order vs. recommended run order: **0001 → 0003 → 0002**.
> 0002 is applied last because its Phase B is the only step that changes what
> data the database returns, so it should land after the schema is settled.

## 0002 — the RLS rollout (read before running)

Today every table uses `allow_all using(true)`, and data isolation happens only
in client code (`App.jsx` filters by `assigned_agent_id`). Any authenticated
user can read every row by issuing an unfiltered query. 0002 moves that scoping
into the database.

**This cut enforces scoping on `contacts`, `activities`, `tasks`** — the tables
where a codebase audit confirmed enforcement is correct and non-breaking.
`deals` and `commissions` are **deferred** (policies are written but left
inactive in the file) because they are entangled with the brokerage-wide
Commission page — see the decision note below.

It is split into phases so it can land with zero downtime:

### Phase A — safe to run immediately
Creates the helper functions and the scoped policies. Because the existing
`allow_all` policy is OR-combined with these, **the tables stay fully open** —
applying Phase A changes nothing a user can observe.

### Verify (ideally in a staging project) before Phase B
Sign in as a **normal (non-admin) agent** and confirm:
- Contacts and Tasks pages show the **same rows as before**.
- Creating a contact/task assigned to yourself succeeds.
- `select * from contacts` returns **only** your + sharing-peers' rows.
- Cold Calls import still works (dedup now checks your contacts only).
- The Campaigns recipient picker now lists your contacts only (intended).
- A contact's Activity tab still shows its history.

`/api/*` endpoints use the service key and bypass RLS, so Twilio, DocuSign,
cron (sequence-run), and campaign tracking are unaffected.

### Phase B — activates enforcement
Uncomment and run the `PHASE B` block (drops `allow_all` on
contacts/activities/tasks). After this, the database enforces scoping.

### Rollback
Run the `PHASE B-ROLLBACK` block — it recreates `allow_all` and reopens the
tables instantly.

### Edge cases to know
- A task inserted with a null `agent_id` would be rejected once Phase B is live
  (the app always sets it, so this does not happen in normal use).

### Decision needed before hardening `deals` / `commissions`
`src/pages/Commission.jsx` is a **brokerage-wide report** (org totals, per-agent
leaderboard, cap tracking) — today every agent sees the whole firm's numbers.
The deferred deals/commissions policies (written, inactive, in 0002) would make
a **non-admin** see only their own data there; **admins are unaffected**.
Decide: is firm-wide earnings visibility meant for everyone (keep those tables
permissive, or admin-gate the page) or for admins only (then the deferred
policies are the intended hardening)? Also scope the unscoped client reads
(App.jsx:329, Commission.jsx:554-555) at that time.

## Known follow-ups (not yet written)

These are deliberately deferred and documented so they aren't lost:

1. **`properties` RLS.** The public `PropertyLanding` page reads `properties`
   anonymously (`src/pages/PropertyLanding.jsx`). Scope it only after that read
   is routed through a service-key API (or given a narrow anon SELECT policy),
   otherwise the public page breaks.
2. **Ghost-table RLS.** The tables consolidated in 0003 currently keep the
   permissive `allow_all` policy. Extend 0002's helpers to them once 0002 is
   proven in production.
3. **`option_value_counts` view.** Queried by `DataManagement.jsx` but never
   defined; its per-value counting logic is field-specific and must be confirmed
   with the team before it can be written correctly. The app degrades to zeros
   when it is absent.
4. **`templates` / `agents`.** Currently shared across all agents by design —
   left permissive intentionally; revisit only if per-agent isolation is wanted.

## Conventions

- Number files `NNNN_short_description.sql`, zero-padded, monotonically.
- Keep every statement idempotent (`if [not] exists`, `drop ... if exists`).
- Never modify or delete an already-applied migration — add a new one.
- When a migration adds/changes a table, also update `src/lib/schema.sql` so a
  fresh install stays in sync.
